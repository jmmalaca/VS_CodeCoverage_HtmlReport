###VS_CodeCoverage_HtmlReport .v1.0

####LINQPad C# Program File

#####Needs:
- Visual Studio .coveragexml file to read the data

If you use the Visual Studio Code Coverage (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd537628.aspx) you will have a report that can be safe to a .coveragexml file. This file can be loaded on VS but if you want to see the same results without the VS you can use this tool.
